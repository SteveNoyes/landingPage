        <p class="pushDown">I need informational website on my business. 8-10 pages will be a good fit for me, my company is base on Agriculture products. such products are Kola Nut, Gacillia Nut and Cocoa so i need best layout design, the site would only be informational, so i need you to check out this site but i need something more perfect than this if its possible. I need you to give me an estimate should include hosting and i have a private project consultant, he has the text content and the logos for the site.
        </p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I want only English language</li>
          <li>I don’t have a domain yet but i want the domain name as (qualityfarmproduce.us)</li>
          <li>you will be updating the site for me</li>
          <li>i will be proving the images, logos and content for the site.</li>
          <li>i want the site up and running before ending of next month.</li>
          <li>My budget is $6000USD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kindly get back to me with an estimate,</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">I have to say that I was eager to get working so I went ahead and looked at the sample site and spent the rest of the night setting up and starting to create the site. I thought it would impress the client if I had taken the initiative. </p>
        <p>It wasn’t until I was switching out some placeholder images that I had to look up up images for Kola nuts and cocoa and Gacillia nuts. I didn’t find any images just a litany or articles detailing exactly the same story as the one I went through. Some of them even dated back five years.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;">I also woke up to this email. </p>
      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>hanks for response, i wanna proceed so i will be depositing $2,300 using credit card so work can commence ASAP, i understand the content for this site would be needed so as for the job to commence so regarding the content i will need a Lil favor from you and the reason i need this favor from you is because the consultant does not have the facility to charge credit cards and i also am presently in the hospital for surgery so i will be glad if you can help me out with this favor,The favor i need from you is. i would give you my card info’s to charge for $6,400 so $2,300 would be a deposit payment for my website design and the remaining $4,000 you would help me send it to the project consultant that has the text content and the logo for my website so once he has the $4,000 he would send the text content and logo needed for my website to you also the funds would be sent to him via cash deposit into his account, sending of funds would be after funds clear into your own account and also $100 tip for your stress.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">I didn’t want to throw away the whole project and when I found out gacillianuts domain wasn’t taken, I reconfigured it into this. A simple site that will, hopefully, inform people before they make a similar mistake.</p>
